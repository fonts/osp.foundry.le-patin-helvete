Le Patin helvète
==============


This file provides detailed information on Le Patin helvète font software.
This information should be distributed along with the Le Patin helvète fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
--------------------------
Le Patin helvète is a re-interpretation of Nimbus Mono and was designed in Wroclaw at the occasion of Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM 2008).
For more detailed information: http://ospublish.constantvzw.org

We took Nimbus as the base of the design. We proceeded to remove the serifs with raw cuts. We did not soften the edges. We are not here to be polite.
See the file NotCourierSans-work.png included in this package.

Basic Latin: 95/95 
Latin-1 Supplement: 93/96
Latin Extended-A: 128/128
Latin Extended-B: 7/208
